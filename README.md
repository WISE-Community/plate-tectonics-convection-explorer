A model to help students learn about convection in convergent and divergent plate boundaries.
See it running live [here](https://wise-community.github.io/plate-tectonics-convection-explorer/).

Add a `maxWidth` query string (number of pixels) to set maximum model width.
Here's an [example](https://wise-community.github.io/plate-tectonics-convection-explorer/index.html?maxWidth=800).
